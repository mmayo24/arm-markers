<p class="p1a"><strong>IMAGE RESOLUTION</strong><br>
    When it comes to FULL-COLOR the first rule of thumb is: Input Quality equals Output Quality.
    Many families submit photos and images whose resolution or actual physical size handicaps the quality 
    of the final image.  The best images have both high resolution and are of a large size.  
    Should you have further questions, please feel free to speak with our art department.</p>
