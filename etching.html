<P class="p1"><strong>HAND ETCHED ARTWORK & PORTRAITS</strong><br>
Classic and elegant, hand etched images are by far the most realistic artistic memorial portraits 
that can be acheived on a headstone. Hand diamond etched images have a more lifelike quality than do machine 
diamond etched images, and are far superior to laser etching a portrait or image - which does not deeply 
impact the stone in the same way that hand diamond etching does.<br>

Using specialized diamond-plated tools and skilled artistry. 
For best results, hand etched memorial portraits should be at least 6" tall. A high quality photo is needed to 
achieve an accurate likeness - the better the quality of the photo submitted, the better the final result of the 
portrait will be on the gravestone.</P>

    <strong>Can etching be done on any color granite?</strong>
    
Monument Etching
To achieve the very fine detail, and to maximize the enduring crispness and clarity, we do not etch colored, gray or 
white granite monuments. Etched designs must be made on black granite only.

Our etching technique is permanent. Designs, pictures, scenes and portraits may be either plain or color-etched
We can use photos of most size and subject matter: from single and family portraits to panoramic ranch and farm 
scenes

<p class="p1a"><strong>IMAGE RESOLUTION</strong><br>
    When it comes to etching the first rule of thumb is: Input Quality equals Output Quality.
    Many families submit sub-par photos and images whose resolution or actual physical size handicaps the quality 
    of the final etched image.  The best etchings have both high resolution and are of a large size.  
    Should you have further questions, please feel free to speak with our art department.</p>

    <strong>Etching is a method used to transfer more detailed images onto granite.</strong><br>
    The image can be a portrait of your loved one, a nature scene or anything that will personalize your 
    memorial of distinction. We first create a freehand drawing to scale which is transferred 
    to the headstone. We then precision etch the image by hand directly into the polished 
    surface. We can even add color to the etching (touch color).<br>
