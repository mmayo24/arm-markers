    <strong>INNOVATIVE DESIGNS</strong><br>
    You may want something - a little more contemporary and a little traditional.  We love this kind of design
    challenge.  This is where we separate ourselves from others.  We do not leave you selecting what's only 
    available in a manufacturer's catalog. Unlike others, we design and modify it right here in-house making for a swift 
    approval process.<br>
    Call us <br> <strong>(860) 924-4292 or email: arm.markers@yahoo.com</strong>

<strong>Are foundations always required?</strong>
Not always required.  It is mostly governed by cemetery requirements, however we believe in a proper foundation. 
The way we install our markers guard against sinking or twisting. Ask us about our installation process and how we do it.
